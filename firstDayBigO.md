steps can be any number of length and irl it is not generally defined

in the ase of function calls for ex it can be number of (f) calls

ex: 

fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
fib(1) = 1, fib(2) = 1

n      |     result     |    steps
1               1               1
2               1               1
3               2               3 
4               3               5 
5               5               9

fib steps = previous steps total


2 to the power of n 

constant - steps never change
linear = steps go up as set goes up (2 cards - 2 steps, 10 cards - 10 steps)
log n (aka log base 2) = everytim you pick a card, you cut the size of the set in half and so on for any pick  => [binary search]

Super SLOW:
exponential (2 to the n)

n log n = sorting (a tiny bit slower than linear)
